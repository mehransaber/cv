        <p>History of the HTML<br> language
        To understand where HTML came from, we need to take a short trip back to 1991. When Mr. Tim Berners-Lee started his work on 18 tags or simple tags and designed the first version of HTML. HTML improved day by day and provided designers with more features in the form of more useful tags in each version.
        In this way, this language gradually solved its previous problems. HTML4 was introduced in 1999 and was able to be used by web designers for a long time, until the biggest evolution in HTML history happened with the introduction of HTML5. This version of HTML was able to help developers more in designing websites, which we want to get to know more about.</p></td>
